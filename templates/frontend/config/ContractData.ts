/**
 * ðŸ›  HOW TO USE YOUR ABI:
 * 1. After deploying your contract (e.g., using Foundry),
 *    locate the generated ABI file â€“ e.g.:
 *    out/MyToken.sol/MyToken.json
 * 2. Copy this ABI into: frontend/abi/MyToken.json
 * 3. Update STAKE_STREAM_ADDRESS below with the address from your deployment
